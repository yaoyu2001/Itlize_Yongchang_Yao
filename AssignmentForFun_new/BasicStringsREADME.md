# Basic Strings

Create a class `BasicStrings` and make some tests pass. :)

* `flipConcat` should concatenate `string1` to the end of `string2`.

* `getChar` should get the `index` character of `string`.

* `iCantSee` should return a `String` of whitespace the same length as `string`.

* `loudAndClear` should return a `String` that is the equivalent of `string` with all uppercase letters.

* `reverseCase` should return the `string` but switches the casing of alphabetical characters.

* `oneAtATime` should merge the inputs one character at a time and return that `String`.
